# Feature Specification: Core Backend API - Phase 1

**Feature Branch**: `[001-feature-core-backend-api]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement the core backend API for user, company, and permission management as defined in the PRD (Phase 1)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: actors (Company Admin), actions (CRUD on companies, users, departments), data (company, user, department entities), constraints (Phase 1 scope)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major clarifications needed, PRD is detailed.
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Completed.
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Completed.
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Completed.
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Completed.
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **Company Administrator**, I need to manage companies, departments, and user accounts via API so that I can set up the organizational structure for the timesheet system, enabling frontend applications to perform these tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a request with valid data for a new company, **When** a `POST` request is sent to the `/api/v1/companies` endpoint, **Then** the system creates a new company, returns a `201 Created` status, and the new company's data.
2. **Given** an existing company, **When** a `POST` request with a valid department name is sent to `/api/v1/companies/{companyId}/departments`, **Then** the system creates a new department linked to that company and returns a `201 Created` status.
3. **Given** an existing company, **When** a `POST` request with valid user data (username, password, role) is sent to `/api/v1/companies/{companyId}/users`, **Then** the system creates a new user, securely hashes the password, and returns a `201 Created` status.
4. **Given** an authenticated user with the `company_admin` role, **When** a `GET` request is made to `/api/v1/companies/{companyId}/users`, **Then** the system returns a paginated list of all users belonging to that company.
5. **Given** an authenticated user who is NOT a `company_admin` (e.g., `employee`), **When** they attempt to access a management endpoint like `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/users`, **Then** the system returns a `403 Forbidden` error.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when creating a user with a username that already exists? (System should return a `409 Conflict` error).
- How does the system handle requests with a non-existent `companyId` in the URL? (System should return a `404 Not Found` error).
- How does the system handle requests with missing required fields in the request body? (System should return a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error with details).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-API-001**: The system MUST provide RESTful endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `companies` resource.
- **FR-API-002**: The system MUST provide RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on the `departments` resource, which must be nested under a specific company (e.g., `/api/v1/companies/{companyId}/...`).
- **FR-API-003**: The system MUST provide RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on the `users` resource, also nested under a company.
- **FR-API-004**: All management endpoints MUST be protected and only accessible by users with the `company_admin` role, adhering to **Constitution Principle III (Security by Design)**.
- **FR-API-005**: The `users` API MUST NOT expose password hashes or other sensitive data in its responses. All passwords in requests must be securely hashed before storage.
- **FR-API-006**: All API endpoints that return a list of resources (e.g., `GET /users`) MUST implement pagination to prevent performance degradation, adhering to **Constitution Principle V (Testability & Maintainability)**.
- **FR-API-007**: All data entities (`users`, `departments`, etc.) MUST be strictly associated with a `company_id` to enforce the **Constitution Principle I (Multi-Tenant Architecture)**.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Company**: Represents a tenant in the system. Contains basic information and is the root for all other company-specific data. (Corresponds to `companies` table in PRD).
- **Department**: A grouping of users within a single company. (Corresponds to `departments` table in PRD).
- **User**: An individual account within a company, with a specific role (`employee`, `department_head`, `company_admin`). (Corresponds to `users` table in PRD).
